HousingPricePrediction---Machine-learning
 Implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features and attributes of properties.
End TO end EDA performed.  Used GridSearch CV as it came out with comparitively good accuracy. 
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered housing dataset, cleaned and preprocessed data, and standardized features.
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, and amenities to enhance model performance.
Model Selection and Training: Employed regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression) and evaluated their performance using cross-validation techniques.
Model Evaluation and Tuning: Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated the model's performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) on test data.
Challenges : Feature Selection: Employed feature importance techniques to select the most impactful features for accurate predictions, used RFE to find out the best features.
Skills demonstrated throughout this project are:
   Data preprocessing and feature engineering
    Regression modeling and evaluation
    Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
     Data visualization to understand housing market trends
